# A repository for code left by Joe Armstrong, the original creator of Erlang. 

Anything you see here I have either found to be either a source of delight, or a source of insight: clarity onto a weird world of great code. Almost always, it's both.

This repository is meant to share the joy of Erlang, and to act as an archive for at least some of its teachings.

**Programs**

*universal_server.erl*

A program that creates a "universal server": a server that can become any server.
